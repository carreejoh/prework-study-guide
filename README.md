# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description

This project was designed to accomplish a couple of things. Firstly it created a simple website which can be easily referenced for notes on what I've learned; but even more importantly, the act of building this guide gave me a solid introduction to the type of coding I'll be doing throughout the bootcamp. Finishing this website proved I'll be able to smoothly transition into a more rigirous course, and set me up for success.

## Usage

This study guide can be used to record useful notes about the different topics learned throughout the bootcamp, and can store them in organized sub categories. The study guide is also quite useful for experiementing with different types of code and seeing their output in the console, or seeing the visual effects on the webpage. The console also provides information about the website, and can be used to randomly decide which topic to study first.
